# Diamond Crate
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/3377

## Crate Mod
This mod adds an upgrade for the Better Crates mod: https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/146

Dauron was kind enough to edit his Better Crates mod to allow other mods to add crate upgrades just for this mod. Huge thanks to him.

## Store ALL the things
This upgrade works on Steel Crates to push the storage to 2048 stacks. 

## Code
The mod is here on GitHub to help others learn how to mod a mod. Or more specifically to add upgrade levels to Better Crates.
